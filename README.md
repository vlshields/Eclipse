# Eclipse
Eclipse is a two-player strategy game where Light and Shadow armies battle on a 10x10 grid. 

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to download and test pre-release versions from this repo. I have built the binaries for as many systems as I can, but it is difficult to thoroughly test on all operating systems. Thusly I will rely heavily on the feedback of others. You are absolutely welcome to make suggestions on the source files, but I cannot in good consience suggest or request that. The game.lua file alone is around 2,000 lines and I did not modularize the codebase well.  

### Installing and Testing the game
- Windows: Download and run the executable
- MacOS: Download and extract the zip file. You will need to allow the game to run by forcing it your privacy/security settings (first run only)
- Debian: sudo apt install ./eclipse_xx.yy.zz.deb
- Archive file: love eclipse.love


## Bug Reports and Feature Requests
Please see the existing issues for a template if you are unsure of how to structure your report/request. If you encounter a bug that is not already listed please provide as much detail as possible about your system and the bug so that I can reproduce it. The issues tab will also give you a sense of the project timeline and what is being worked on currently.
