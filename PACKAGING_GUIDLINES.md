# Packaging Guidlines

If you are willing and able to contribute to this project by packaging this game for your favorite distribution/package-manager, here are some general guidlines. Thank you very much for your efforts!

### Setting up

Fork this repo and download the latest .love archive from the [releases page](https://github.com/vlshields/Eclipse/releases). Clone your fork locally and create a new folder where the build will go. The folder should be
named after the packaging method or distribution you are packaging for. For example, if you are building an Appimage create a folder called "appimage". Likewise, if you are packaging a .deb, create a folder named "debian". 
As long as it's clear, the actual name of the folder doesn't matter too much.

### Packaging 
Please use eclipse_logo.png as the icon. Once you have comleted your build, please place it in your build folder along with the original .love file and open a [pull request](https://github.com/vlshields/Eclipse/pulls). I will
review the PR within a few days and likely merge it.


Thank you for considering a contribution!
