Creating a Windows Executable
Once you have packed your game into a .love file you can create a game executable that directly runs your game.

For this you have to append your .love file to the love.exe file that comes with the official LÖVE .zip file. The resulting file is your game executable.

Once you have your game executable you can pack it together with all the other DLL files of the official LÖVE .zip file into a new .zip file and share this with the world.

Platform Specific Instructions
Windows
To create your game executable under windows use the command line to run

   copy /b love.exe+SuperGame.love SuperGame.exe
Note: You may have to run the command as an administrator on your computer. You can do this by going to Windows\System32 and right clicking on cmd.exe and selecting the option Run as administrator. After this, you must type cd C:\Program Files\LOVE\ (or whatever your default love directory is), then you may continue as normal.

Alternatively you can create a .bat (e.g. create_game_exe.bat) file with the contents

   copy /b love.exe+%1 "%~n1.exe"
and then you can simply drag your SuperGame.love file onto the .bat file and it will create the file SuperGame.love.exe which you could then use for distribution.

If you are using PowerShell instead of cmd, then use the following command:

   Get-Content love.exe,SuperGame.love -Encoding Byte | Set-Content SuperGame.exe -Encoding Byte
or invoke cmd from PowerShell using the following:

   cmd /c copy /b love.exe+SuperGame.love SuperGame.exe
This method creates a fused game.

When distributing the Windows executable you will need to include the dll files that came in the folder of the love.exe you used (so don't mix the 32 bit dll's with the 64 bit dll's). Without these files you will get error message when attempting to run SuperGame.exe on a windows machine.

The contents of your final distribution folder should look something like this:

SDL2.dll
OpenAL32.dll (note: this file is different in the 64 bit download despite still being called 'OpenAL32.dll')
SuperGame.exe
license.txt (note: the license requires that it be included in any further distribution)
love.dll
lua51.dll
mpg123.dll
msvcp120.dll
msvcr120.dll


Windows icon
You can use your own icon images using tools like for example the freeware Resource Hacker.

Linux / macOS
You can create the windows executable from Linux and macOS using the command line.

First download the official zipped 32 or 64 bit executable (not the installer) from https://www.love2d.org/. 32 bit games can run on 64bit Windows systems but not vice versa, so to save time on smaller games, you can provide 32bit only.

Then in the command line/terminal run

   cat love.exe SuperGame.love > SuperGame.exe
to obtain the game executable SuperGame.exe.
