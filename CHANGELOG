eclipse-v0.2.19 (Current Stable)
--------------------------

eclipse-v0.2.17 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

Replaced play again button with a png asset:

    - Now uses game.buttonPlayAgain instead of game.buttonJoinGameSmall
    - Removed the manual text drawing 

eclipse-v0.2.16 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

Barely any change. Updated the verbiage in "How to Play"

eclipse-v0.2.15 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

Fix network freeze bug caused by receive("*a") overwhelming server thread:

  - Changed network receive calls from reading all available data at once to reading in 4KB 
  chunks, which prevents the server thread from locking up during high network traffic. 
  
  - Added buffer size limits and improved error handling to ensure stable performance during 
  gameplay. 
  
  - This resolves the issue where the game would freeze during online multiplayer due
   to inefficient message processing.


eclipse-v0.2.14 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

1) Fixed network freeze bug caused by message fragmentation in server thread:

 - The server was using line-mode receive() without buffering, causing partial messages to be
 lost when TCP packets were fragmented. This led to desynchronization between clients and
 the server, resulting in gameplay freezes.
  
 - Added proper message buffering to the server thread matching the client's implementation, ensuring all fragmented messages are correctly
 reassembled.

2) Added data validation to the load save file function(s)

eclipse-v0.2.13 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

- Added a turn counter
 - Single Player: Counts the number of turns the player (Player 1/Light) has taken.
 - Multiplayer (Online mode): Counts the number of turns from the perspective of each player separately

Fixed play again freeze bug in online multiplayer

- Removed the surrender button from single player mode

eclipse-v0.2.12 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

1) Option added in online multiplayer mode for players to "rematch" without exiting the game via a "Play Again?" button that appears on the victory screen

2) The option for a player to forfeit the match has been added via a buttion in the lower left hand corner

3) Alternate win condition confirmed to work

eclipse-v0.2.11 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

1) Music and Volume settings are now saved for when a player loads the game again.

2) A player's acquired achievments are now rendered in green text in the stats page.

3) Added a new game over tune.


eclipse-v0.2.10 
--------------------------

Patch Notes:

1) New Feature: In online multiplayer, players can no longer see where the other player is placing their pieces during board setup. 
This eliminates any inquiries of flag placement (players tend to place their flag first). A counter that displays how many pieces have been placed
was added so that players know the game isnt idling/frozen.

2) UI asset updates.


eclipse-v0.2.9 
------------------

Patch Notes:

1) New feature added where the AI player's pieces are also revealed on the board just like in multiplayer

2) Updated infiltrator inception achievement verbiage for clarity

eclipse-v0.2.8
---------------------

Patch Notes:

 1. Added AI Knowledge Storage (game.lua:172)
    - game.aiKnownPieces = {} - Stores piece ranks by piece ID
  2. AI Learns from Combat (game/combat.lua:60-71)
    - When any battle occurs, the AI learns about player 1's pieces involved
    - Knowledge is stored by piece ID for persistence
  3. AI Uses Knowledge in Decisions (game/ai/darkness.lua:207-263)
    - Known pieces: AI uses actual rank to make smart decisions
    - Unknown pieces: AI uses heuristics based on position:
        - Probes back rows (1-2) with low-rank pieces
      - Tests middle rows (3-4) with mid-rank pieces
      - Attacks front lines more aggressively
      - Adds randomness to avoid predictable patterns
  4. State Reset (game/state.lua:259)
    - Knowledge clears when starting a new game

eclipse-v0.1.7 
-----------------------
